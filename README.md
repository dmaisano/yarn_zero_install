# Yarn Zero Installs: https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs

> ensure that you have nodejs and yarn installed. I have `node v16.14.0` installed alongside `yarn v1.22.15`

Running the projects without installing any dependencies!

1. clone and cd into the project directory.
  - `git clone https://github.com/dmaisano/yarn_zero_install.git`
  - `cd yarn_zero_install`
  
2. run the project with `yarn start` or `yarn run start`

### notes

- Yarn should use the version specified in the [.yarnrc.yml](.yarnrc.yml) file. In this case it will use `yarn-3.1.1`
